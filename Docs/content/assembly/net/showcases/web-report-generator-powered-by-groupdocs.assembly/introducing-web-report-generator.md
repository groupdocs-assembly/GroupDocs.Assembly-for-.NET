## Introduction to Web Report Generator Powered by GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET

Web Report Generator is an ASP.NET Web forms application using GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET that demonstrates the core functionalities provided by GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET. The Web Report Generator allows user to easily create reports based on: a) Predefined custom templates (created in [Supported Document Formats]({{< ref "assembly/net/getting-started/supported-document-formats.md" >}) following [Supported Template Syntax]({{< ref "assembly/net/developer-guide/working-with-groupdocs.assembly-engine/template-syntax-part-1-of-2.md" >}})) and b) Your own database (MS SQL Server local OR Remote) tables, views and also with custom query. The UI of the application is kept very simple for easy understanding and developers can enhance the features as their own needs since it is an Open Source Project.
