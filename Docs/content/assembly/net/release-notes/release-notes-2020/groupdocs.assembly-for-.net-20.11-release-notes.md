### Supported Working with .NET Standard 2.0 Implementations

Starting with version 20.11, GroupDocs.Assembly supports working with .NET Standard 2.0 implementations such as .NET Core 2.0 and later. For more information on .NET Standard 2.0 implementations, see [.NET Standard documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard#net-implementation-support).

#### Working with GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET Standard 2.0 in Your Project

GroupDocs.Assembly is built on top of several Aspose products. Some of the products use [SkiaSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp/) to deal with graphics-related tasks within .NET Standard 2.0, whereas the others prefer [System.Drawing.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/). That is why, GroupDocs.Assembly depends on the both packages.

A recommended way to deal with these and other GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET Standard 2.0 dependencies is installing of [GroupDocs.Assembly NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GroupDocs.Assembly/). Otherwise, you can install all dependencies listed at [the NuGet package page](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GroupDocs.Assembly/) manually.

Depending on OS you work on, you may need to install some additional dependencies. Learn more about these dependencies in the article ["How to Work with GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET Standard 2.0"](https://docs.groupdocs.com/assembly/net/how-to-work-with-groupdocs.assembly-for-.net-standard-2.0/).
