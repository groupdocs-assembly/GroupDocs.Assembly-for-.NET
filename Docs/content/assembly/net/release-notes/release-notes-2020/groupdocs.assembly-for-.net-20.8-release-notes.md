## Public API and Backward Incompatible ChangesÂ 

{{< alert style="info" >}}This section lists public API changes that were introduced in GroupDocs.Assembly for .NET 20.8. It includes not only new and obsoleted public methods, but also a description of any changes in the behavior behind the scenes in GroupDocs.Assembly which may affect existing code. Any behavior introduced that could be seen as a regression and modifies existing behavior is especially important and is documented here.{{< /alert >}}

### Supported dynamic generation of GS1-128 AI 8102 Coupon Extended and UPCA & GS1 Databar Coupon barcodes

From now, the following identifiers can be used to generate GS1-128 AI 8102 Coupon Extended and UPCA & GS1 Databar Coupon barcodes:

| Identifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| code128GS1UPCA | GS1-128 AI 8102 Coupon Extended barcode |
| databarGS1UPCA | UPCA & GS1 Databar Coupon barcode |

For more information on dynamic insertion of barcodes, see [Barcodes Syntax and Properties](https://docs.groupdocs.com/assembly/net/barcodes-syntax-and-properties/).

### Improved barcode scaling

Starting from this version, barcode scaling is supported for the most of barcode types. For more information on scaling of barcodes, see [Scaling Barcode Symbols](https://docs.groupdocs.com/assembly/net/barcodes-syntax-and-properties/#scaling-barcode-symbols).

### Changed API for working with barcode image resolution

Starting from the 20.8 version, GroupDocs.Assembly introduces a single property to deal with both vertical and horizontal barcode image resolutions. For more information, see [Setting Barcode Image Resolution](https://docs.groupdocs.com/assembly/net/barcodes-syntax-and-properties/#setting-barcode-image-resolution).

#### New members of BarcodeSettings

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the horizontal and vertical resolution of a barcode image being generated. Measured in dots
/// per inch. The default value is 96.
/// </summary>
public float Resolution { get; set; }
```

#### Members of BarcodeSettings marked as obsolete

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the horizontal resolution of a barcode image being generated. Measured in dots per inch.
/// The default value is 96.
/// </summary>
[Obsolete("Use the Resolution property for both horizontal and vertical resolution.")]
public float XResolution { get; set; }

/// <summary>
/// Gets or sets the vertical resolution of a barcode image being generated. Measured in dots per inch.
/// The default value is 96.
/// </summary>
[Obsolete("Use the Resolution property for both horizontal and vertical resolution.")]
public float YResolution { get; set; }
```
